# Introduction #

The framework was created when Grid computing and peer-to-peer computing were interesting ideas to play with.  However, the current trend in computing requires parallel computing int two areas: multi-core and the cloud (or a cluster for researchers).  Given those trends, we would like to split the pattern parallel programming development code into two projects.  One for multi-core and one for cloud.

# Multi-Core #
More to come soon...
... Pattern programming library for Android platform
# HPC Cloud #
More to come ...
... This section will include research objectives for Seeds on the cloud.
